on Thursday in a Dev question video I answered the question what is a back-end developer and what do they do yesterday I showed you how to become a back-end developer with C sharp and today it's time to challenge your skills in back-end development with c-sharp while you've been using c-sharp for a long time or just started working with it this challenge should teach you something about where your skills are at and what you still need to work on so let's jump right into the challenge the challenge is to build a capture or build a system to capture purchase data from a caller store the data in a database now I'll pause right here this is vague wording because again I have tried to keep this as open as possible you could be building an API or you could be playing a class Library it's up to you how you want to capture this purchase data from a caller okay so build a system to capture purchase data from a caller store the data and database if there's a duplicate user update their data instead of adding a new record so let's say I purchase a book you take the information and store the database Tim purchased a book then let's say that Sue purchases a a t-shirt so you put that information database new record Sue purchased a t-shirt now let's say I purchased a t-shirt so you'd say okay well Tim already has a record in the database so let's just add purchase a t-shirt into Tim's record or in some way associate with my existing uh record that way you don't have two different entries for Tim in the database okay so that's your goal for building a system again it's up to you how you build it and what part of C sharp you build it in what type of project you use with the class Library if it is that's great but you might want to write some unit tests or something to verify that actually works um or an API and maybe write the um the HTTP file to test your API um or whatever you decide for how you're going to capture purchase data from the caller and that color you're going to make up the purchase that it's sending in but I want you to store this in a database and again which database up to you do you want nosql database like  or Cosmos cool do you want a SQL database like SQL server or SQL Lite or MySQL cool go for it up to you you choose what you want to do all right so it's up to you but I want you to take on this Challenge and as I said before it's important that you put the effort in to get this challenge done rather than just wait until Friday when I release my solution video because just watching a solution video is going to give you a kind of a warm fuzzy feeling of oh I understand this now probably but that's not really what the way to get the most information out of this process the way to get the most information out is for you to do it first yourself even if that means holding off and watching a solution video until after you've really figured out how I make this work and I have written your own application now this one doesn't have to be pretty because there's no UI but this one does have to be functionally correct meaning I will make sure that you're thinking through things like data input errors or information is wrong or checking that the duplicates come in and not as duplicates and all other information that could go wrong make sure you test for it in your final product make sure it's actually going to work and not just for you know the easy stuff make sure that you throw some curveballs at it and make sure it still stands up and it still works correctly okay the way you do is up to you but you really need to show off your skills as a back-end developer here so you can do a lot of different things with logging or dependency injection or the way you structure your application or how it's built whatever you want to do but think through how you want to build this to best show off what you can do as a back-end developer all right get to it [Music] [Applause] [Music]
